# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [States of a Process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/states-of-a-process-in-operating-systems/) <br>
    - New (Create) – In this step, the process is about to be created but not yet created, it is the program which is present in secondary memory that will be picked up by OS to create the process.
    - Ready – New -> Ready to run. After the creation of a process, the process enters the ready state i.e. the process is loaded into the main memory. The process here is ready to run and is waiting to get the CPU time for its execution. Processes that are ready for execution by the CPU are maintained in a queue for ready processes.
    - Run – The process is chosen by CPU for execution and the instructions within the process are executed by any one of the available CPU cores.
    - Blocked or wait – Whenever the process requests access to I/O or needs input from the user or needs access to a critical region(the lock for which is already acquired) it enters the blocked or wait state. The process continues to wait in the main memory and does not require CPU. Once the I/O operation is completed the process goes to the ready state.
    - Terminated or completed – Process is killed as well as PCB is deleted.
    - Suspend ready – Process that was initially in the ready state but were swapped out of main memory(refer Virtual Memory topic) and placed onto external storage by scheduler are said to be in suspend ready state. The process will transition back to ready state whenever the process is again brought onto the main memory.
    - Suspend wait or suspend blocked – Similar to suspend ready but uses the process which was performing I/O operation and lack of main memory caused them to move to secondary memory.
    When work is finished it may go to suspend ready.

2. [Process Table and Process Control Block (PCB)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-table-and-process-control-block-pcb/) <br>
  While creating a process the operating system performs several operations. To identify the processes, it assigns a process identification number (PID) to each process. As the operating system supports multi-programming, it needs to keep track of all the processes. For this task, the process control block (PCB) is used to track the process’s execution status. Each block of memory contains information about the process state, program counter, stack pointer, status of opened files, scheduling algorithms, etc. All these information is required and must be saved when the process is switched from one state to another. When the process makes a transition from one state to another, the operating system must update information in the process’s PCB.

3. [Thread](https://www.javatpoint.com/threads-in-operating-system) <br>
  There is a way of thread execution inside the process of any operating system. Apart from this, there can be more than one thread inside a process. Thread is often referred to as a lightweight process. The process can be split down into so many threads. For example, in a browser, many tabs can be viewed as threads. MS Word uses many threads - formatting text from one thread, processing input from another thread, etc.

4. [Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm) <br>
  The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy. Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.

5. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling) <br>
  CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair. Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the processes in the ready queue to be executed. The selection process is carried out by the short-term scheduler (or CPU scheduler). The scheduler selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them.

6. [Interprocess Communication](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-interprocess-communication) <br>
  Interprocess communication is the mechanism provided by the operating system that allows processes to communicate with each other. This communication could involve a process letting another process know that some event has occurred or the transferring of data from one process to another.

7. [Socket](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_sockets/what_is_socket.htm) <br>
  Sockets allow communication between two different processes on the same or different machines. To be more precise, it's a way to talk to other computers using standard Unix file descriptors. In Unix, every I/O action is done by writing or reading a file descriptor. A file descriptor is just an integer associated with an open file and it can be a network connection, a text file, a terminal, or something else.

8. [Multicore Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-multicore-programming) <br>
  Multicore programming helps to create concurrent systems for deployment on multicore processor and multiprocessor systems. A multicore processor system is basically a single processor with multiple execution cores in one chip. It has multiple processors on the motherboard or chip. A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is might be included in a multiprocessor system. A FPGA is an integrated circuit containing an array of programmable logic blocks and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects. Input data is processed by to produce outputs. It can be a processor in a multicore or multiprocessor system, or a FPGA.

9. [Thread Libraries](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html) <br>
  There are three main thread libraries in use today:
    * POSIX Pthreads - may be provided as either a user or kernel library, as an extension to the POSIX standard.
    * Win32 threads - provided as a kernel-level library on Windows systems.
    * Java threads - Since Java generally runs on a Java Virtual Machine, the implementation of threads is based upon whatever OS and hardware the JVM is running on, i.e. either Pthreads or Win32 threads depending on the system.

10. [Implicit threading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/implicit-threading-and-language-based-threads) <br>
  One way to address the difficulties and better support the design of multithreaded applications is to transfer the creation and management of threading from application developers to compilers and run-time libraries. This, termed implicit threading, is a popular trend today.
  Implicit threading is mainly the use of libraries or other language support to hide the management of threads. The most common implicit threading library is OpenMP, in context of C.
