# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Address Binding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/) <br>
Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. Logical address is address generated by CPU during execution whereas Physical Address refers to location in memory unit(the one that is loaded into memory).Note that user deals with only logical address(Virtual address). The logical address undergoes translation by the MMU or address translation unit in particular. The output of this process is the appropriate physical address or the location of code/data in RAM.

2. [Compile Time Errors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compile-time-errors-and-runtime-errors/) <br>
Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing syntax are known as Compile-Time errors. This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compile-time errors.

3. [Runtime Errors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compile-time-errors-and-runtime-errors/) <br>
Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time error is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs.

4. [Logical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) <br>
Logical Address is generated by CPU while a program is running. The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as Virtual Address. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program’s perspective.

5. [Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) <br>
Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The term Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a Logical address space.

6. [Memory Protection](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Memory_protection) <br>
Memory protection is a way to control memory access rights on a computer, and is a part of most modern instruction set architectures and operating systems. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it. This prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself. Protection may encompass all accesses to a specified area of memory, write accesses, or attempts to execute the contents of the area. An attempt to access unauthorized[a] memory results in a hardware fault, e.g., a segmentation fault, storage violation exception, generally causing abnormal termination of the offending process. Memory protection for computer security includes additional techniques such as address space layout randomization and executable space protection.

7. [Memory Allocation](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27492/memory-allocation) <br>
Memory allocation is primarily a computer hardware operation but is managed through operating system and software applications. Memory allocation process is quite similar in physical and virtual memory management. Programs and services are assigned with a specific memory as per their requirements when they are executed. Once the program has finished its operation or is idle, the memory is released and allocated to another program or merged within the primary memory.

8. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/) <br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non – contiguous.

9. [Swapping](https://www.javatpoint.com/swapping-in-operating-system) <br>
Swapping is a memory management scheme in which any process can be temporarily swapped from main memory to secondary memory so that the main memory can be made available for other processes. It is used to improve main memory utilization. In secondary memory, the place where the swapped-out process is stored is called swap space. The purpose of the swapping in operating system is to access the data present in the hard disk and bring it to RAM so that the application programs can use it. The thing to remember is that swapping is used only when data is not present in RAM.

10. [Fragmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(computing)) <br>
Fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both. The exact consequences of fragmentation depend on the specific system of storage allocation in use and the particular form of fragmentation. In many cases, fragmentation leads to storage space being "wasted", and in that case the term also refers to the wasted space itself. For other systems (e.g. the FAT file system) the space used to store given data (e.g. files) is the same regardless of the degree of fragmentation (from none to extreme).
