# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem) <br>
  Critical Section is the part of a program which tries to access shared resources. That resource may be any resource in a computer like a memory location, Data structure, CPU or any IO device.
  The critical section cannot be executed by more than one process at the same time; operating system faces the difficulties in allowing and disallowing the processes from entering the critical section.
  The critical section problem is used to design a set of protocols which can ensure that the Race condition among the processes will never arise.

2. [Race Condition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/) <br>
  When more than one processes are executing the same code or accessing the same memory or any shared variable in that condition there is a possibility that the output or the value of the shared variable is wrong so for that all the processes doing the race to say that my output is correct this condition known as a race condition. Several processes access and process the manipulations over the same data concurrently, then the outcome depends on the particular order in which the access takes place.
  A race condition is a situation that may occur inside a critical section. This happens when the result of multiple thread execution in the critical section differs according to the order in which the threads execute.

3. [Memory Barriers](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt) <br>
  Independent memory operations are effectively performed in random order, but this can be a problem for CPU-CPU interaction and for I/O. What is required is some way of intervening to instruct the compiler and the CPU to restrict the order.
  Memory barriers are such interventions. They impose a perceived partial ordering over the memory operations on either side of the barrier.
  Such enforcement is important because the CPUs and other devices in a system can use a variety of tricks to improve performance, including reordering, deferral and combination of memory operations; speculative loads; speculative branch prediction and various types of caching.  Memory barriers are used to override or suppress these tricks, allowing the code to sanely control the interaction of multiple CPUs and/or devices.

4. [Compare and Swap](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/compare-and-swap.html) <br>
  Compare and swap is a technique used when designing concurrent algorithms. Basically, compare and swap compares an expected value to the concrete value of a variable, and if the concrete value of the variable is equals to the expected value, swaps the value of the variable for a new variable.

5. [Atomic Variables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/atomic-variables-in-java-with-examples/) <br>
  In mutithreading, the shared entity mostly leads to a problem when concurrency is incorporated. A shared entity such as, mutable object or variable, might be changed, which may result in the inconsistency of the program or database. So, it becomes crucial to deal with the shared entity while accessed concurrently. An atomic variable can be one of the alternatives in such a scenario.
  Java provides atomic classes such as AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicBoolean and AtomicReference. Objects of these classes represent the atomic variable of int, long, boolean, and object reference respectively.

6. [Mutex and Semaphore]() <br>
  A mutex provides mutual exclusion, either producer or consumer can have the key (mutex) and proceed with their work. As long as the buffer is filled by producer, the consumer needs to wait, and vice versa. At any point of time, only one thread can work with the entire buffer. The concept can be generalized using semaphore. A semaphore is a generalized mutex. In lieu of single buffer, we can split the 4 KB buffer into four 1 KB buffers (identical resources). A semaphore can be associated with these four buffers. The consumer and producer can work on different buffers at the same time. <br>
  There is an ambiguity between binary semaphore and mutex. We might have come across that a mutex is binary semaphore. But they are not! The purpose of mutex and semaphore are different. May be, due to similarity in their implementation a mutex would be referred as binary semaphore.

7. [Bounded Buffer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bounded-buffer) <br>
  Bounded buffer problem, which is also called producer consumer problem, is one of the classic problems of synchronization. There is a buffer of n slots and each slot is capable of storing one unit of data. There are two processes running, namely, producer and consumer, which are operating on the buffer. A producer tries to insert data into an empty slot of the buffer. A consumer tries to remove data from a filled slot in the buffer. As you might have guessed by now, those two processes won't produce the expected output if they are being executed concurrently. There needs to be a way to make the producer and consumer work in an independent manner.

8. [Dining Philosopher Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dining-philosopher-problem-using-semaphores/) <br>
  The Dining Philosopher Problem states that K philosophers seated around a circular table with one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pickup the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both.

9. [Readers-Writers Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/readers-writers-problem) <br>
  The readers-writers problem relates to an object such as a file that is shared between multiple processes. Some of these processes are readers i.e. they only want to read the data from the object and some of the processes are writers i.e. they want to write into the object. The readers-writers problem is used to manage synchronization so that there are no problems with the object data. For example - If two readers access the object at the same time there is no problem. However if two writers or a reader and writer access the object at the same time, there may be problems. To solve this situation, a writer should get exclusive access to an object i.e. when a writer is accessing the object, no reader or writer may access it. However, multiple readers can access the object at the same time.

10. [Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/) <br>
  Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. Consider an example when two trains are coming toward each other on the same track and there is only one track, none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other. A similar situation occurs in operating systems when there are two or more processes that hold some resources and wait for resources held by other(s). For example, in the below diagram, Process 1 is holding Resource 1 and waiting for resource 2 which is acquired by process 2, and process 2 is waiting for resource 1.
